## 💡 SUCCESS STRATEGY

### **Daily Schedule:**
- **8:00 AM - 12:00 PM:** Deep work on code (4 hours)
- **12:00 PM - 1:00 PM:** Lunch break
- **1:00 PM - 5:00 PM:** Continue coding (4 hours)
- **5:00 PM - 6:00 PM:** Break
- **6:00 PM - 8:00 PM:** Testing & documentation (2 hours)
- **Total:** 10 hours/day focused work

### **Key Principles:**
1. ✅ **Start with authentication** - Everything depends on it
2. ✅ **Test as you go** - Don't wait until end
3. ✅ **Deploy early** - Test on Render by Day 4
4. ✅ **Document while fresh** - Write API docs as you build
5. ✅ **Skip perfection** - Working > Perfect
6. ✅ **Use SQLite first** - Switch to PostgreSQL on deployment
7. ✅ **One payment gateway** - Flutterwave is enough

## 📋 QUICK START CHECKLIST (Do NOW!)

### Immediate Steps (30 minutes):
```bash
# 1. Create .env file
cp .env.example .env
nano .env  # Add basic config

# 2. Use SQLite for speed (edit settings.py)
# Comment out PostgreSQL, use SQLite default

# 3. Run migrations
source venv/bin/activate
python manage.py migrate

# 4. Create superuser
python manage.py createsuperuser

# 5. Test server
python manage.py runserver

# 6. Access admin
# Visit: http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin
```
