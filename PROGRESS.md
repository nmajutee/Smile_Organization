# smile organization progress

## stuff that works
- django installed (4.2.16)
- all apps created  
- custom user model with email login
- sqlite database
- rest framework installed
- cors setup (kinda)

## working on now
- trying to make user registration api
- jwt authentication (confusing)
- need to test with postman

## todo next
- projects crud
- donations payment
- blog
- calendar
- deploy somehow

## known bugs/issues
- cors allows everything (security issue)
- no email verification yet
- password validation weak
- phone not validated
- admin role anyone can set (bad)
- sqlite not production ready
- secret key exposed

## notes to self
- remember to change debug to false
- fix allowed hosts
- switch to postgresql
- add proper permissions
- write some tests maybe?
